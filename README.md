Loan Prediction System
======================

This repository contains the code for a machine learning-based Loan Prediction system. The project is organized into three part files, each containing different approaches to predict loan eligibility.

File Structure
--------------

- Folder: `part1`
  - `part1.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing code for:
    - Naive Bayes classifier
    - Ensemble model using VotingClassifier
- Folder: `part2`
  - `part2.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing code for:
    - Gradient Boosting Classifier
    - KNN Classifier
    - Logistic Regression Classifier
    - Random Forest Classifier
- Folder: `part3`
  - `part3.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing code for:
    - Random Forest Classifier with cross-validation
    - Deep Learning model using TensorFlow

---

The code is written in Python and requires the following libraries:

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `scikit-learn`
- `tensorflow` (for deep learning models)
- `matplotlib` (for data visualization)

Make sure to have these libraries installed in your Python environment before running the code.
